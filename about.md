## Who is Troop 86?
Boy Scout Troop 86, (in existence over 60 years) offers a diverse, well rounded, scouting program exemplifying the Scout Law and focused on Scouting Activities and Camping Trips to develop outstanding Scouts. We are a “Boy Led” Troop, The Boys themselves develop the yearly program and take responsibility to run it.  Our Scouts have contributed hundreds of hours of service to the community and thrived through our Scout led program.  

## What have our scouts done?
Troop 86 has celebrated over 80 Eagle Scouts to date.  The Troop has Scouts on Camp Staff at both Monmouth Council Summer Camps, teaching Merit Badges and supporting Boy Scout Troops, Venture Crews, and Webelos to enhance their Summer Camp experience.  The Troop has led efforts for Food Drives, directly supported our Troops in Afghanistan, packaged food for the disadvantaged, participated in numerous Civic Events, most recently picking 5,000lbs of vegetables, in conjunction with Farmers against hunger, to be donated to local food banks.
